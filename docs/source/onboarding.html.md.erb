# Onboarding

<%= image_tag 'buses.jpg' %>

Pay's services are deployed to [GOV.UK PaaS][paas] using pipelines on the [GDS shared Concourse][cd].
The steps on this page should get you ready to start working on deploying Pay's services to your own developer environment using Cloud Foundry.

## Prepare your laptop

You'll need to install a couple of tools to work with Pay's services.
If you're a [Homebrew][homebrew] user, you can run the following in the [pay-omnibus repository][this-repo]:

```sh
brew bundle install
```

## Get GOV.UK PaaS account

Pay's services are deployed to [GOV.UK PaaS][paas].
You can learn a bit more about GOV.UK PaaS and Cloud Foundry from the [PaaS technical documentation][paas-docs].

The developer environments are deployed to PaaS London.
After [registering for an account][paas-ldn-register], ask an org manager on your team to give you access to Pay's organisation on PaaS London.
They can do this by following the [PaaS guidance on adding users][paas-add-users].

Once you've been invited to the organisation, try logging in:

```sh
cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
```

You should be able to target the `govuk-pay` organisation and the `sandbox` space.

## Get your own developer environment

Now that you have a PaaS account, you can have your very own Pay developer environment within your own PaaS space.
Modify the `ci/config/dev-pipelines.yml` file to add your own environment, making sure to change the `name`, `vars.developer` and `vars.user` fields.
The value for `vars.user` can be found by running

```sh
cf target
```

and copying the value displayed after `user:`.

Raise a pull request with your changes and have it reviewed and merged.
The `provision-dev-envs` Concourse pipeline should pick up the change and roll out a new pipeline to provision your developer environment.
