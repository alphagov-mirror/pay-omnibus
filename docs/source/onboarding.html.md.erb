# Onboarding

<%= image_tag 'buses.jpg' %>

Pay's services are deployed to [GOV.UK PaaS][paas] using pipelines on the [GDS shared Concourse][cd].
The steps on this page should get you ready to start working on deploying Pay's services.

If you find any issues with the information here, please raise an issue or pull request against these docs using the links at the bottom of the page.

## Prepare your laptop

You'll need to install a couple of tools to work with Pay's services.
If you're a [Homebrew][homebrew] user, you can run the following in the [pay-omnibus repository][this-repo]:

```sh
brew bundle install
```

## Get GOV.UK PaaS account

Pay's services are deployed to [GOV.UK PaaS][paas].
You can learn a bit more about GOV.UK PaaS and Cloud Foundry from the [PaaS technical documentation][paas-docs].

The first thing you should do is ask an org manager on your team to give you access to Pay's organisation on GOV.UK PaaS.
They can do this by following the [PaaS guidance on adding users][paas-add-users].

Once you've been invited to the organisation, try logging in:

```sh
cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
```

You should be able to target the `govuk-pay` organisation and the `sandbox` space.

## Get your own developer environment

Now that you have a PaaS account, you can have your very own Pay developer environment within your own PaaS space.
Modify the `ci/config/dev-pipelines.yml` file to add your own environment, making sure to change the `name`, `vars.developer` and `vars.user` fields.
The value for `vars.user` can be found by running

```sh
cf target
```

and copying the value displayed after `user:`.

Raise a pull request with your changes and have it reviewed and merged.
The `provision-dev-envs` Concourse pipeline should pick up the change and roll out a new pipeline to provision your developer environment.
